# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Layout

This repo uses a single-context domain-doc layout:

- `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root for project domain language, when it exists
- `docs/adr/` for architecture decisions, when it exists

## Before exploring, read these

- `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root
- `docs/adr/` ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in

If any of these files don't exist, proceed silently. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill, reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`, creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

```text
/
|-- CONTEXT.md
|-- docs/
|   `-- adr/
|       |-- 0001-example-decision.md
|       `-- 0002-example-follow-up.md
`-- src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, or a test name, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use, or there's a real gap to note for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> Contradicts ADR-0007 (example decision), but worth reopening because...
